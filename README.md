# nodeCallbacks
A callback function, which is a function that is called when a task is finished, aids in avoiding blocking by allowing other code to run in the interim. Callback is the asynchronous version of a function that is invoked when a job is finished. Node.js is very scalable because it uses the callback notion to process a huge number of requests without waiting for any function to produce the response. For instance: When a function in Node.js begins reading a file, it instantly returns control to the execution environment so that the subsequent command can be carried out. Callback functions are invoked once file I/O is finished in order to prevent blocking or waiting for file I/O.
